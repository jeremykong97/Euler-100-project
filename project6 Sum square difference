# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 385

# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, 3025

# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is . 2640

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# sum square difference

# thoughts 
# i would just go brute force since the computer could calculate that 
# first by finding the sum of the saquare from 11 to 100
# then find the square of the sum from 11 to 100 
# subtract them and add by 2640

sum_square = 0
square_sum = 0
sum = 0
for i in range(0, 101):
    sum_square += i*i                       # calculate sum of squre
    sum += i
square_sum = sum * sum                      # calculate square of sum
total = sum_square - square_sum
print(total)

# hence the difference is 25164150
