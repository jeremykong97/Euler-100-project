# 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

# What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Thoughts since 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by all of the number from 1 to 10 , then we could figure out the smallest number by multiple the numbers by x in range of 11 to 20. However, there exist some common divisor that is needed to be divided in between. 

import math
sum = 2520
for i in range (11, 21):                    # go through the list
    sum *= i // math.gcd(sum,i)             # multiple by integer and 
                                            # divdes by the GCD
print(sum)
