# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


# thoughts

# i can check for the first digit and the last digit, if those aren't same, then next()
# also in order to be palindromic number, the number of digits of the product must be even
# the least 6  digits number is 100000 which is multiplied by two number that is bigger than 316
# the biggest 6 digits number is 999999 which is multiplied by two number that is smaller than 1000
